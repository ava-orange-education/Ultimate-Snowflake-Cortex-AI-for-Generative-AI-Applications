REVIEW,RATING
"The agent was extremely helpful throughout the entire process. They showed us multiple properties that fit our budget and needs, explaining the pros and cons of each one in detail. We felt confident making an informed decision and are thrilled with our new home.",5
"I felt the process was too rushed, and the agent didnâ€™t provide enough information about the houses we were shown. It felt like they were more interested in closing a deal quickly than helping us find the right fit. A little more time and patience would have been appreciated.",2
"I had a fantastic experience! The realtor was professional, knowledgeable, and really went the extra mile to help me find my dream home. They answered all my questions, offered great advice, and the closing process was a breeze thanks to their thorough preparation.",5
"Our realtor was incredibly patient and understanding. They walked us through each step of the buying process and explained every detail, from the mortgage to the neighborhood. We never felt pressured, which made the experience very comfortable and positive.",5
"The online photos and description portrayed a recently renovated home with modern finishes, but upon arrival, it was far from it. The renovations appeared to be superficial at best - fresh paint over cracking walls and new cabinet faces attached to deteriorating structures.",1
"While the home has some appealing features, the asking price of $575,000 is simply not justified based on the property location and comparable homes in the area.Similar homes in this neighborhood have recently sold for $450,000-$490,000.",2
